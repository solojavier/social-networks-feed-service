* Twitter  : https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

# You need to setup the enviroment by running the following commands in root of the project from Terminal

* "gem install bundler"
* "bundle install"

# To actually run the service use this command:

* "ruby service.rb"

# Go to "http://localhost:4567" and have fun
